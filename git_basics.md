# Git Basics

## Getting a Git 

You typically obtain a Git repository in one of two ways:

1. You can take a local directory that is currently not under version control, and turn it into a Git repository.
2. You can *clone* and existing Git repository from elsewhere.

In either case, you end up with a Git repository on your local machine, ready for work.
