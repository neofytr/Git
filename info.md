# About Version Control

Version control is a system that records to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later. 

It allows you to revert selected files back to a previous state, revert the entire project back to a previous state, compare changes over time, see who last modified something that might be causing a problem, who introduced an issue and when, and more. 

Using a version control system also generally means that if you screw things up or lose files, you can easily recover. In addtion, you get this all for very little overhead.

# What is Git?

Git is a distributed version control system. Even though Git's user interface is fairly similar to other distributed version control systems, Git stores and thinks about information in a very different way.
